welcome 
in this video we will talk about Text recognizer 
we will use ML kit with Firebase 

-you can also extract text from pictures,
which you can use to increase accessibility or translate documents.
 
- by using this api you can recognizer Text language 

- ok let's started ..
 
- first thing you should have an account in firebase 
and make the first project like this .. 

- just now you should connect your project into firebase 




- now let's make some design in our application 
 
 
- first take an image from the camera 
	ok lets access camera to take a phote 
	i will speed the vidio in this section 
	
	
- then converted image into bitmap object
-  we gonna pass on that bitmap object into firebase vision image object 
-  we process the image using firebase vision text recognizer

- we use an OnSuccessListener to determine when detection is complete 
	- if successful ,i can access a firebaseVisionText object
